## Bitbucket vs GitHub : 


Choosing a repository hosting service is a big decision. How you host your code is an important part of your work and affects your productivity. So you’ll want to make sure you choose the platform that’s most conducive to your (and your team’s) specific needs and goals.

If you’re like most developers, you’re probably using Git as your Version Control System (VCS). However, deciding where to host the source code can be challenging. Two of the most popular options are Bitbucket and GitHub, but how do you decide which one is right for you?

In this post, we’ll discuss the importance of choosing the right code repository. Then we’ll look at Bitbucket vs GitHub to see how the two compare.


## Why Choosing the Right Code Repository System Is Important for Developers
Your repository hosting service is the third-party application that enhances your VCS (which in most cases is Git). The code repository you use can play a pivotal role in your development workflow.

For example, it influences your ability to collaborate with other members on your team, and the efficiency of that process. It also affects how you measure, monitor, and manage your projects. Each code repository system comes with its pros and cons. There are a handful of important considerations to take into account when comparing them, including:

VCS support
Collaborator access
Interface and usability
Extensions and third-party integrations
Pricing plans
Another major factor to think about is whether you’re looking for a public or a private repository. Certain platforms are better suited for one use case or the other, so it’s important to know upfront what you’re going to need.

Among the two most popular choices for source code repositories are Bitbucket and GitHub. While they are similar in many ways, there are some key differences worth considering before deciding which option is best for your development project needs.

## An Introduction to Bitbucket and GitHub
Bitbucket and GitHub are hosting platforms that provide both public and private repositories for developers. In terms of functionality, Bitbucket and GitHub operate in very similar ways. With both, you can perform basic commands such as:

Creating and managing repositories
Logging in using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Making pull requests
Conducting code reviews
Using inline editing and Markdown support
Performing issue tracking
However, in order to truly understand both platforms, it’s necessary to take a closer look at what each brings to the table.
